Global Forest Watch makes the best available data about forests available online for free, creating unprecedented transparency about what is happening in forests worldwide. Better information supports smarter decisions about how to manage and protect forests for current and future generations, and greater transparency helps the public hold governments and companies accountable for how their decisions impact forests. GFW data is accessed daily by governments, companies, civil society organizations, journalists, and everyday people who care about their local forests.",

For example, we have supported governments to use our open source platform to create customized online maps that support national policy planning and implementation. GFW's private sector team works with the worldâ€™s biggest food producers to help them use GFW tools to identify and eliminate deforestation in their supply chains. The GFW Small Grants Fund provides civil society organizations with technical and financial support to help them apply GFW data in their research, advocacy, and fieldwork.",
